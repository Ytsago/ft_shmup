Hello !\n
This is my own creation of the project ft_shmup of 42 school\n
The makefile almost work but unfortunatly something may have gone wrong\n
You can use cc *.c -Wall -Werror -Wextra -lncurses to compile the code if you want,\n
The executable should be with the sources files\n
To execute it open a terminal and run ./ft_schmup\n
Have fun :]

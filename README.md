Hello !
This is our own creation of the project ft_shmup of 42 school
The makefile almost work but unfortunatly something may have gone wrong
You can use cc *.c -Wall -Werror -Wextra -lncurses to compile the code if you want
The executable should be with the sources files
To execute it open a terminal and run ./ft_schmup
Have fun :]
